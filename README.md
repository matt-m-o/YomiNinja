The extracted text overlays the original content, allowing for quick look-ups with pop-up dictionaries like [10ten](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader), [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) and [Inkah](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/inkah-chinese-korean-pop/pcgmedbmchghfgikplcimdmfldfnecec). <br>
It minimizes distractions and simplifies the process of looking up unfamiliar words. <br>
This is especially beneficial for language learners who study through videos or games.

YomiNinja is perfect for:

- Language learners who study through games, videos, or any other visual content.
- Anyone who values a distraction-free, efficient way to look up unfamiliar words.
- Users looking for seamless text extraction and workflow improvement.

## Dictionary Extensions
YomiNinja supports web browser dictionary extensions, enabling convenient word lookup without external applications. <br>
While not all extensions are currently installable, [10Ten](https://github.com/birchill/10ten-ja-reader) and [Yomitan](https://github.com/themoeway/yomitan) have been successfully tested and are included as pre-installed options for simplified installation. <br>


## Installation
### Windows
You need Windows 10 or 11 and [VCRedist](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one/) installed. <br>
If you are using the N or KN edition of Windows 10 or 11, please be aware that you will also need to install the [Media Feature Pack](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/media-feature-pack-list-for-windows-n-editions-c1c6fffa-d052-8338-7a79-a4bb980a700a). This is necessary to ensure that all the required DLLs are installed.

[Download](https://github.com/matt-m-o/YomiNinja/releases) and install the latest YomiNinja release. <br>

### Linux
YomiNinja currently offers support for distros using the X11 window system. Wayland is not supported due to its limitations with global shortcuts and window positioning.
1. Install [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
2. Download the YomiNinja package corresponding to your distribution.
3. Install the package. For example, on Debian-based distributions:

    ```commandline
    sudo dpkg -i yomininja-e_x.x.x_amd64.deb

    cd ./ocr_services/py_ocr_service
    ./gen_grpc_service.bat
    ./build.bat
    cd ../..
    ./copy_py_ocr_service_build.bat
    ```
